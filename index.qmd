1. To convert an angle from radians to degree, multiply the angle by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. So 
   $$\frac{5\pi}{6}\cdot\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}=150^\circ.$$

2. Using the definition of cosine, the length of $AC$ satsifies the equation $\cos 40^\circ=\frac{AC}{200 \text{ m}}$. So 
   $$AC=200 \text{ m} \cdot \cos 40^\circ \approx 153.2 \text{ m}.$$

3. To get a cofunction with same value, replace the given angle by its complement. So 
   $$\csc\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{5}\right)=\sec\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)=\sec\sec\left(\frac{5\pi}{10}-\frac{4\pi}{10}\right)=\sec\left(\frac{\pi}{10}\right).$$

4. Let $A$ be the end of the ramp on the street, $B$ the end of the ramp at the entrance of the clinic, $C$ is the point on the street right below $B$. 
   
   ![Right triangle with an angle 4 degrees and opposite side 2](Q4.jpeg)
   
   The length of the ramp $AB$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle $\triangle ABC$. The length of the street $AC$ is the adjacent side of the right triangle and the height of the building $BC$ is the opposite side of the right triangle. The angle of elevation is the angle between the street and the ramp, that is, $\angle A$. With $\angle A = 4^\circ$, $BC =  2 \text{ ft}$, the length of the ramp satisfies the equation $\tan 4^\circ = \frac{2 \text{ ft}}{AC}$. Solving for $AC$ gives the length of the ramp
   $$AC = \frac{2 \text{ ft}}{\tan 4^\circ} \approx 28.6 \text{ ft}.$$

5. The reference angle is the acute angle formed by the terminal side and the $x$-axis. Once the terminal side is determined, the reference angle can be found by measuring the angle between the terminal side and the $x$-axis. The angle of $242^\circ$ has the terminal side in the third quadrant. The reference angle is $242^\circ-180^\circ=62^\circ$.

6. To convert an angle from radian to degree, multiply the angle by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. So 
   $$135^\circ = \frac{135\pi}{180} = \frac{3\pi}{4}.$$

7. From the definition of sine and cosine of an arbitrary angle $\theta$, $x = r\cos\theta$ and $y = r\sin\theta$, where $(x, y)$ is a point on the terminal side and $r$ is the distance from the origin. Because $\csc\theta = 1/\sin\theta <0$ and $\sec\theta = 1/\cos\theta >0$, then a point on the terminal side has $y<0$ and $x>0$. So the terminal side is in the fourth quadrant.

8.  The find $\sin \theta$ from a given point on the terminal side, divide the $y$-coordinate by the distance from the origin. In this case, the distance between $(-3, 4)$ and the origin is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{(-3)^2+4^2} = 5$. So
   $$\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{-3}{5}.$$

9.  Coterminal angles are different angles that have the same terminal side. To find a coterminal angle, add or subtract a multiple of $360^\circ$ (or $2\pi$) to the given angle. Since the given angle is negative and desired coterminal angle is positive and less than $360^\circ$. We add multiples of $360^\circ$ so that the angle is positive and less than $360^\circ$. So the desired coterminal angle is
    $$-685^\circ + 2\cdot 360^\circ = 35^\circ.$$


10. To determine the exact value of $\sin\theta$ with the given measure of $\theta$, one can use the reference angle $\theta_{\text{ref}}$. If the terminal side is in Quadrant I or II ($y>0$), then $\sin\theta =\sin \theta_{\text{ref}}$. Otherwise, $\sin\theta = -\sin \theta_{\text{ref}}$. In this case, the terminal side of $\dfrac{4\pi}{3}$ is in Quadrant III, and the reference angle is $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$. Therefore, $$\sin \dfrac{4\pi}{3} = -\sin \dfrac{\pi}{3} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$
    **Remark:** Trig of special angles in $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ can be found using the left hand trick. See for example <https://www.geogebra.org/m/cGKXJnxZ>. 

11. For a function $y= A\cos(Bx)$, the amplitude is $|A|$ and the period is $\dfrac{2\pi}{|B|}$. In this case, the amplitude is $|3|=3$ and the period is $\dfrac{2\pi}{|\frac{\pi}{6}|}=12$. To sketch the graph within one period, first find the 5 key points: the maximum, the minimum, the points on the middle. When inside function is simple $Bx$, the first point can be taken as $(0, A\cos(0))=(0, -3)$. Let $T$ be the period. The second point can be taken as $\left(\dfrac{T}{4}, A\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2})\right)=(3, 0)$, the third point can be taken as $\left(\dfrac{T}{2}, A\cos(\pi)\right)=(6, 3)$, the fourth point can be taken as $\left(\dfrac{3T}{4}, A\cos(\dfrac{3\pi}{2})\right)=(9, 0)$, and the fifth point can be taken as $\left(T, A\cos(2\pi)\right)=(12, -3)$. Then connect the points smoothly to get the graph.

12. The reference angle is the acute angle formed by the terminal side and the $x$-axis. Once the terminal side is determined, the reference angle can be found by measuring the angle between the terminal side and the $x$-axis. The angle of $\dfrac{8\pi}{9}$ has the terminal side in the second quadrant. The reference angle is $$ \pi-\frac{8\pi}{9}=\frac{\pi}{9}. $$

13. Given $\sin\beta$, the value of $\cos\theta$ can be find algebraically using the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$. Since $\sin\beta = \dfrac89$ and $beta$ is acute, $\cos\beta = \sqrt{1-\sin^2\beta} = \sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac89\right)^2} = \dfrac{\sqrt{17}}{9}$. 
    
    The value of $\cos\beta$ can be found using the right triangle. Let $\angle C$ be the right angle and $A$ be the given angle. Take the hypotnuse $AB=9$ and the opposite side $BC=8$. Then by the geometric Pythogorean theorem, $AC=\sqrt{9^2-8^2}= \sqrt{17}$. So $\cos\beta = \dfrac{AC}{AB} = \dfrac{\sqrt{17}}{9}$.

14. Since the angle of $120^\circ$ is in the second quadrant, the reference angle is $180^\circ-120^\circ=60^\circ$. The value of $\tan 120^\circ$ can be found using the reference angle. Since $\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}$, then $\tan 120^\circ = -\tan 60^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$.

15. Because $\tan\theta < 0$, the termial side of $\theta$ is in the second or the fourth quadrant. Because $\cos\theta < 0$, the terminal side of $\theta$ is in the second quadrant.

16. Let $A$ be the observation point on the ground, $B$ be the top of the building, and $C$ be the bottom of the building. Note that $\angle C$ is the right angle, and $\angle A =71^\circ$. 
    
    ![Right triangle with hypotenuse 60 and an angle 71 degrees](Q16.jpeg)
    
    Because the distance between $A$ and $C$ is 60 meters. The hight of the building $BC$ is the opposite side of the angle $\angle A$. By the definition of sine, $\sin 71^\circ = \dfrac{BC}{60 \text{ m}}$. Solving for $BC$ gives the height of the building
    $$BC = 60 \text{ m} \cdot \sin 71^\circ \approx 174.3 \text{ m}.$$

17.  Since $\theta$ is acute and $\cos\theta = \dfrac67$. Then $$\sin\theta=\sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac67\right)^2} = \dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{7}.$$

18.  Since $A$ is in the third quadrant, then $\cos A$ is negative. Using the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2A + \cos^2A = 1$, we have $\cos A = -\sqrt{1-\sin^2A} = -\sqrt{1-\left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = -\dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{4}$. Using the quotient identity $\tan A = \dfrac{\sin A}{\cos A}$, we have $$\tan A = \dfrac{-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}{-\dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{4}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.$$

19. Similar to Question 11, the amplitude is $|A|=|2|=2$, the period is $\dfrac{2\pi}{|B|}=\dfrac{2\pi}{|\frac{1}{3}|}=6\pi$.

    The 5 key points are $(0, 0)$, $(1.5\pi, 2)$, $(2\pi, 0)$, $(4.5\pi, -2)$, and $(6\pi, 0)$. Connect the points smoothly to get the graph.

20. Since $\tan\theta = -\frac12$ and $\cos\theta>0$, the angle $\theta$ is fourth quadrant. To find the values of the trigonometric functions without sign, we can apply the geometric method to $\theta_{\text{ref}}$ as see in Question 13. Consider the triangle with the opposite side $1$ and the adjacent side $2$. The hypotenuse is $\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\sqrt{5}$. Then $\sin\theta_{\text{ref}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$, $\cos\theta_\text{ref} = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$. Therefore, 
    $$\sin\theta = -\dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{5},$$
    $$\cos\theta = \dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5},$$
    $$\tan\theta = -\dfrac{1}{2},$$
    $$\csc\theta = -\sqrt{5},$$
    $$\sec\theta = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{2},$$
    $$\cot\theta = -2.$$

21. The cofunction with the same value as $\tan 78^\circ$ is $\cot(90^\circ-78^\circ)=\cot 12^\circ$.

22. Since the given angle is greater than $2\pi$, to find the cotermimal angle in $[0, 2\pi]$, we subtract multiples of $2\pi$ from the given angle. So the coterminal angle in $[0, 2\pi]$ is
    $$\dfrac{17\pi}{5} - 2\pi = \dfrac{7\pi}{5}.$$

23. Let $A$ be the bottom of the ladder, $B$ the top of the ladder, and $C$ the point on the ground right below $B$. 
    
    ![Right triangle with hypotenuse 25 and adjacent 18](Q23.jpeg)
    
    Since the ladder is 25-foot long and the bottom of the ladder is 18 feet from the wall, we have $AC=18$ and $AB=25$. The angle formed by the ladder and the ground is $\angle A$, which statisfies the equation $\cos A = \dfrac{18}{25}$. 
    Solving for $A$ gives the angle
    $$A = \cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{18}{25}\right) \approx 44^\circ.$$

    The height of the top of the ladder can be calculated by $BC = 25\sin A \approx 25\sin 44^\circ \approx 17.3$ feet.

    Note that $BC$ can also be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $$BC = \sqrt{25^2-18^2} = \sqrt{625-324} = \sqrt{301} \approx 17.3 \text{ ft}.$$


24. Let $A$ be the starting point of the road, $B$ the ending point on the road, and $C$ the point such that the triangle $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $C$ the right angle.

    ![Right triangle with hypotenuse 5000 and an angle 5 degrees](Q24.jpeg)
    
    Since the driving distance is 5000 meters and the angle of elevation is $5^\circ$, the increase in altitude is the opposite side $BC$ of the right triangle. By the definition of sine, we have 
    $$\sin 5^\circ = \dfrac{BC}{5000 \text{ m}}.$$ Solving for $BC$ gives the increase in altitude
    $$BC = 5000 \text{ m} \cdot \sin 5^\circ \approx 436 \text{ m}.$$

25. To convert from radian to degree, multiply the angle by $\dfrac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. So 
    $$2 \cdot \dfrac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 114.59^\circ.$$

26. Since the point is on the unit circle, the distance from the origin is 1. The value of $\cos\theta$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point. So $\cos\theta = \dfrac{1}{2}$. The value of $\sin\theta$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point. Because the point is in the fourth quadrant, $y$-coordinate is negative. So by the Pythagorean identity, $$\sin\theta = -\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta} = -\sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2} = -\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$

27. The distance $r$ from the point on the termimal side to the origin is $$r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{\left(-\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{24}{25}\right)^2}=1.$$ Therofore, by the definition of trigonometric functions of an angle $\theta$, we have 
    $$\sin\theta = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{24}{25},$$
    $$\cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} = -\frac{7}{25},$$
    $$\tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} = -\frac{24}{7},$$
    $$\cot\theta = \frac{x}{y} = -\frac{7}{24}.$$
    $$\sec\theta = \frac{r}{x} = -\frac{25}{7},$$
    $$\csc\theta = \frac{r}{y} = \frac{25}{24},$$

28. Similar to Question, the distance $r$ is $r=\sqrt{12^2+(-5)^2}=13$. Hence the trigonometric functions are
    $$\sin A = \frac{y}{r} = -\frac{5}{13},$$
    $$\cos A = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{12}{13},$$
    $$\tan A = \frac{y}{x} = -\frac{5}{12},$$
    $$\cot A = \frac{x}{y} = -\frac{12}{5}.$$
    $$\sec A = \frac{r}{x} = \frac{13}{12},$$
    $$\csc A = \frac{r}{y} = -\frac{13}{5},$$
